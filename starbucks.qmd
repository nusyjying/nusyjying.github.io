# ʚ♡ɞ Final Project - Starbucks ʚ♡ɞ

As part of the final project of NM2207, we are to construct a data story from a data set of our own choosing. With that in mind, I've chosen to base my data story and project on a data set I've found about Starbucks branches in California!

I'm interested to poke around and explore any observable links and correlations between the common-ness of Starbucks branches and the frequency of certain profiles of the residents, and see what that says about certain stereotypes and branding associated with Starbucks. This is because I am a fan of sweet, iced drinks, and I used  go to Starbucks (the Singapore branches) often to get my fix of coffee or matcha frappuccinos.
