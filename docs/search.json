    "text": "Personal thoughts\nThrough this project, my main questions were that “Does Starbucks everyday association and correlation to (the white) race and socioeconomic status (SES) offer any insightful reflections on consumer culture, social stratification, and branding?” and “Otherwise, is it all just a matter of stereotyping and coincidence?”.\nFrom my own exploration of this plot visualisation app, I personally observe that there doesn’t seem to be a strong correlation between the proportion of Starbucks distribution and most of my variables of concern. The scatterplots do seem quite sparsely separated in the generated graphs, and\nI’m personally looking at Percentage of white population, Median household income, Median age, Number of Starbucks, Starbucks per million inhabitants, and Starbucks per 10 sq mile. In particular, I want to pay special attention to Starbucks per million inhabitants as a way for me to relate the differing populations of the different geographical locations to give me the most apt proportion of Starbucks distribution.\nUltimately, the weak correlation tells me that the association between the frequency of Starbucks branches and outlets in a particular geographical location and factors such as population whiteness, age, and SES is weak. However, the observable positive correlation in the plots between “percentage of white population and Starbucks per million inhabitants” and “median age and Starbucks per million inhabitants” is apparent, which at least suggests that the stereotype that Starbucks leans towards a customer profile and target of satisfaction that may be prominently White.\nInterestingly, the plotted graph between “median household income” and “Starbucks per million inhabitants” shows no correlation unlike what I expected given the common perception that Starbucks is considered an ‘everyday luxury’ or ‘treat’. (Insert more findings and thoughts here as this is still in the works)"

Are they figments of my imagination? Did I simply dream up all our encounters in a fevered daze?\nEvery time I flip through albums of our wonderful times together which now only exist as foggy fragments in the depths of my mind, I feel a strange sense of sentimentality that I can not justify. how dare you still touch my soul so casually, when I can barely even remember who you are to me?\nEven as I gaze into the mirror, the face reflected on the smooth surface does not feel like — or seem to be —mine. The features only contort, shifting further and further into obscurity, until a person I don’t know stares wordlessly back at me through the glass as if taunting me.\nThere seems to be an impending asteroid in the caverns of my skull, zipping and clashing against white-ochre walls and vaporising every last fragment into insignificant specks of cosmic dust.\nPerhaps you are merely a figment of my imagination. A fleeting phantasm. A comrade of my mind’s own making. And our thrilling adventures, our many mishaps, and our echoing laughter are just delusions of grandeur that I indulge in my lonesome. As much as I try, I find it harder and harder every day to convince myself that you and I truly existed.\nStill, I do believe that if everything was a lie and you are but a mirage, you are still the greatest creation my mind has ever brought me.\n…\nIt is as if I had a dream.\nIn the morning, the dream of the night is forgotten. The dream of the night is beautiful. However, the dream vanishes as the morning comes, leaving only an inexplicable feeling of confusion, joy and uncertainty in its wake."

    "text": "ESCAPRIL DAY 30 - Dusk\nWe were both breathless after running through the village the whole day. Our skin, kissed by rays of afternoon sunlight, took on hues of rosy amber as we sprinted through thick bushes of dandelions and wild grass on the open dirt pathway. This was our hidden haven, our secret rendezvous point. The other villagers shunned the surrounding areas, never daring to leave the confinement of their dingy little cottages as the sun made its slowed descent into its home in the mountains. I was scared at first, too, but with the little rose charm you had made me for my birthday last year, I had never felt safer.\n“Wait up!” I managed to squeeze out a wheeze as I followed, heaving behind you as you nimbly scaled the cobblestone walls. You only responded with a hearty giggle before leaping off into the enclosed land.\n“Throw the basket over, I’ll catch it!” Your voice was ever so sprightly as you chirped from the other side of the wall.\nThe basket of wildflowers quivered in my hands, as if aware of its fate. A foolish grin blooms on my lips as I raise the basket high over my head and flung it over the stone. A loud rustling of straw against steady palms signalled to me to begin my climb. Logically, we could have gone the usual way through the big gateway, but today was different.\nMy feet landed solidly on cracked soil. Adrenaline pumping in our veins, we continued our chase, laughing energetically against the stark silence of the cemetery. As we passed a gravestone, we would set a flower stalk on the warmed stone before bounding off to the next. This gifting dance reached its end when we finally stopped in front of the great willow tree. With only a few flowers left in the basket, you tossed it carelessly by the tree’s roots along with your battered backpack before plopping down beside it. Following your example, I took a seat as well. You were strangely quiet now, playing with a bluebell stalk with alabaster fingers. I swiped the backpack and unpacked the bottles and humble sandwiches. The juice bottles were different today, as you had helpfully hinted to me with the uncorked bottle of vodka on the counter before we set off. We were barely legal, but this adult flavour would so poignantly suit this moment.\nYou saw it as another one of our regular sunset getaways, but I knew that this was a different outing. You saw it as another, and I saw it as our last.\nThe sky showed the first signs of the sunset as the blue began to meld into a lovely orange. High above our heads, the sun leisurely reclined against pillows of clouds, dyeing the regular white with hues of warm gold. The russet-gold sky bleeding over the cobblestone walls looked as though it was setting the cemetery ablaze with its glow. With the stray darkened birds that flew in the backlight of the sun, the scenery was dazzling as in its last goodbye to me.\n“Are you okay? You look so gloomy. Come, drink.” A juice bottle was haphazardly shoved into my hands, snapping me out of my stupor. I regained my focus, my eyes centred on your warm smile.\nThe radiancy of your smile sparked a reminder in my head and I quickly fumbled with my patched pockets to fish out a red flower hairpin. This flower was your namesake, a beautiful blooming rose. The crystal flower pin had taken up the most of my saved school lunch money, but when I saw it in that vendor’s stall, I knew that I had to see it in your flaxen hair. Fighting with the wind that was toying with your hair, I fastened the pin into your hair, fixing your bangs so that they no longer obscured your bright eyes.\nYou commented nothing on my wistful smile and only focused on uncapping your own bottle. This was our precious time, and this golden orange sky our trademark landscape. I refused to let my sombre goodbye sour the last memory I will have of you. However, whether I had told you or not, you would have known in the morning. You would have known regardless. Instead, I religiously burned your visage into my eyes so that I would be able to call upon it whenever I wished… after I leave.\n“Come, let’s not be so gloomy now, this is our golden hour! Here, raise your bottle. To our never-ending dusk, my dear, and many more that will follow it!” Raising your drink high above your heart, you shout, startling the sparrows out of the leafy canopy above us.\n“…To our dusk, my Rose.” I murmured, before taking a giant swig from the drink. The bittersweetness, carrying the trademark burn of an adult flavour, made tears brim at the corner of my eyes. I let the pearly droplet roll down the curve of my cheek, and felt it soak into the fabric of my cotton pants.\nI hoped that you would miss me as much as I missed you.\nGoodbye, my loveliest, dearest Rose.\nGoodbye."

    "text": "ESCAPRIL DAY 08 - Hometown\n“Hello. Again, I’ve come to visit.”\nOnce again, I mumble to myself, yet I speak to nobody in particular, for I stood alone. I had sworn to myself that I would leave everything behind in this dingy village, yet today, my legs moved on their own to return to this very place as I did last year. And the year before, and then a year before that.\nThe cooling breeze sweeps over the land, creating a nostalgic cacophony of rustling flora. I stand under the glow of the sunset, watching the unpolluted sky paint itself to resemble one of Michelangelo’s decadent paintings with the vibrancy of a dying sun. Moving with sheer muscle memory, I find my old spot under the great willow tree standing lethargically in the centre of the grounds. My city-dweller hands part the leafy curtains with the practised ease of a village child, and I disregard the wellbeing of my clean pair of jeans to sit on the dirt below its canopy. I lean against the gnarled wood, hearing a creak that seemed to be the only new experience of this land.\nThe tree had never creaked when she and I used to climb it and play back then.\nI sift my fingers through the blooms of white carnations and daisies, arranging them back into the meticulous design that the town florist had done for me, and get to my feet. It wouldn’t do well for me to remain here for so long, I thought. Otherwise, I wouldn’t want to leave. Soft footsteps seem to become so loud with my solitude in this empty space, and my memory pulls me by the hand, guiding me to the last spot where I had last seen her. A shaky breath forces its way out of me, and I twist my lips into a chagrined and sheepish smile.\n“’Sorry that I came so late, Rose. And I’m sorry I’ll have to leave so soon again. In fact, I doubt that I can even come back anymore, with how busy my life has gotten.” I set the bouquet of flowers on the sun-warmed stone before squatting in front of it to clear away any stray weeds and fallen leaves.\n“I wish you had come with me.”\nMy words are drowned out with the whistling wind and a chill seeps into my bones. The sun had already disappeared beyond the horizon, carrying with it our childhood dreams, fantasies, and memories. I stay in my hunched position, discomfort waging a hellish war in my chest and gut. Without warning, a loud crash reverberates behind me, and I turn around to see our poor old weeping willow, halved onto the floor with the push of a breeze. With the fall of our symbol, a clink of an iron chain seemed to echo in my mind, shutting off the warming sentimentality stirring in my soul.\nFor the longest time, the only sound of the cemetery came from the chirping of crickets amongst the dried grass.\nOur old love had already twisted itself into a curse, shackling me back into this empty husk of a place. What use does this idyllic, natural refuge have without the sound of your laughter?\nThis place was never my hometown. You were."
