With that in mind, I’ve chosen to base my data story and project on a data set I’ve found about Starbucks branches in California!\nI’m interested to poke around and explore any observable links and correlations between the common-ness of Starbucks branches and the frequency of certain profiles of the residents, and see what that says about certain stereotypes and branding associated with Starbucks. This is because I am a fan of sweet, iced drinks, and I used go to Starbucks (the Singapore branches) often to get my fix of coffee or matcha frappuccinos.\n\nThis is still a work in progress! This section will be filled out as the semester approaches its end 𓂃 ࣪˖ ִֶָ𐀔"
