## ESCAPRIL DAY 08 - Hometown

"Hello. Again, I've come to visit."

Once again, I mumble to myself, yet I speak to nobody in particular, for I stood alone. I had sworn to myself that I would leave everything behind in this dingy village, yet today, my legs moved on their own to return to this very place as I did last year. And the year before, and then a year before that.

The cooling breeze sweeps over the land, creating a nostalgic cacophony of rustling flora. I stand under the glow of the sunset, watching the unpolluted sky paint itself to resemble one of Michelangelo's decadent paintings with the vibrancy of a dying sun. Moving with sheer muscle memory, I find my old spot under the great willow tree standing lethargically in the centre of the grounds. My city-dweller hands part the leafy curtains with the practised ease of a village child, and I disregard the wellbeing of my clean pair of jeans to sit on the dirt below its canopy. I lean against the gnarled wood, hearing a creak that seemed to be the only new experience of this land.

The tree had never creaked when she and I used to climb it and play back then.

I sift my fingers through the blooms of white carnations and daisies, arranging them back into the meticulous design that the town florist had done for me, and get to my feet. It wouldn't do well for me to remain here for so long, I thought. Otherwise, I wouldn't want to leave. Soft footsteps seem to become so loud with my solitude in this empty space, and my memory pulls me by the hand, guiding me to the last spot where I had last seen her. A shaky breath forces its way out of me, and I twist my lips into a chagrined and sheepish smile.

"'Sorry that I came so late, Rose. And I'm sorry I'll have to leave so soon again. In fact, I doubt that I can even come back anymore, with how busy my life has gotten." I set the bouquet of flowers on the sun-warmed stone before squatting in front of it to clear away any stray weeds and fallen leaves.

"I wish you had come with me."

My words are drowned out with the whistling wind and a chill seeps into my bones. The sun had already disappeared beyond the horizon, carrying with it our childhood dreams, fantasies, and memories. I stay in my hunched position, discomfort waging a hellish war in my chest and gut. Without warning, a loud crash reverberates behind me, and I turn around to see our poor old weeping willow, halved onto the floor with the push of a breeze. With the fall of our symbol, a clink of an iron chain seemed to echo in my mind, shutting off the warming sentimentality stirring in my soul.

For the longest time, the only sound of the cemetery came from the chirping of crickets amongst the dried grass.

Our old love had already twisted itself into a curse, shackling me back into this empty husk of a place. What use does this idyllic, natural refuge have without the sound of your laughter?

This place was never my hometown. You were.
