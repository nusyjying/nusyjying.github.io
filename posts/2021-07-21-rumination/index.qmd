## rumination

i’m chasing the backs

of our younger selves

to lie to myself

that we will never 

grow old and leave

each other 

<br>

i’m chasing the shadows 

of our great past 

so that i don’t 

have to blind myself 

with the light of 

the present 

<br>

i’m chasing the last vestiges 

of our dying sunset 

so i could pretend 

that i don’t have 

to see the next sun 

rise again

<br>

as much as i know 

that the new world 

will give me something

newer, i can never 

let go of all 

that the past has 

given me.
