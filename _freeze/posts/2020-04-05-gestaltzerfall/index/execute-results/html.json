Are they figments of my imagination? Did I simply dream up all our encounters in a fevered daze? \n\nEvery time I flip through albums of our wonderful times together which now only exist as foggy fragments in the depths of my mind, I feel a strange sense of sentimentality that I can not justify. how dare you still touch my soul so casually, when I can barely even remember who you are to me?\n\nEven as I gaze into the mirror, the face reflected on the smooth surface does not feel like — or seem to be —mine. The features only contort, shifting further and further into obscurity, until a person I don’t know stares wordlessly back at me through the glass as if taunting me. \n\nThere seems to be an impending asteroid in the caverns of my skull, zipping and clashing against white-ochre walls and vaporising every last fragment into insignificant specks of cosmic dust. \n\nPerhaps you are merely a figment of my imagination. A fleeting phantasm. A comrade of my mind’s own making. And our thrilling adventures, our many mishaps, and our echoing laughter are just delusions of grandeur that I indulge in my lonesome. As much as I try, I find it harder and harder every day to convince myself that you and I truly existed. \n\nStill, I do believe that if everything was a lie and you are but a mirage, you are still the greatest creation my mind has ever brought me.\n\n...\n\nIt is as if I had a dream.\n\nIn the morning, the dream of the night is forgotten. The dream of the night is beautiful. However, the dream vanishes as the morning comes, leaving only an inexplicable feeling of confusion, joy and uncertainty in its wake. \n",
